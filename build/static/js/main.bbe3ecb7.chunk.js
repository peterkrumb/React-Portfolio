Our requirements were to pick virtually any 2 APIs and make a website from it. The APIs would have to be instructor approved My partner and I chose for this project to use Giphy API as well as an API for basketball stats called BallDontLie. Originally we set out to use Youtube to render a highlight reel for a player when their name was typed in the search bar, but we learned that in the span of time we had it might be too difficult since we had to set up a server, so a Gif was rendered to the screen instead. Going into the project we had done about 2 weeks learning HTML and CSS and the rest of the time mostly JavaScript concepts. The idea of doing an entire project was slightly intimidating at first, however when taking into consideration the fact that we could choose any concept for the project we wanted to as long as it met minimum requirements and also got to work with another person, it made it more reasonable. One of the primary challenges I faced on this project was how we could set the app up to search by the players' names when at first it appeared we could only search by id number. After some time mulling it over and getting advice from various sources, I discovered we could do 2 AJAX calls to the database. The first one would get the player's ID number and the second would plug that ID number into our next call to the database, as shown in the code below."),l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("img",{src:t(35),alt:"code"}),l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null)," ",l.a.createElement("p",null,"This was a big win because it was one of my first big feelings of accomplishment.

Using these technologies was a requirement for the second project, where I needed to use an API again as well as setting up my own database through MySQL. In brainstorming ideas the idea came up of making a car buying app like cars.com. We had learned that you could narrow the parameters of a query to an external database, and I figured that this would work perfectly with buying cars where you could specify the make, model, and year of the car as well as other things like color and price range, and get back all results from the database. There were 3 of us in the group and we all divided the work pretty evenly, as opposed to splitting the work up between stacks. The majority of my work was on the backend with Node however. Node was interesting to learn, because its application meant you can create an entire app from the back end, which is what we did using handlebars.",l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("img",{src:t(36),alt:"garagecode"}),l.a.createElement("br",null),l.a.createElement("br",null)," The code above represents one challenge we faced making the project that we overcame, and this was assigning a unique ID, here coined as \"UUID\", to every person who's computer visited the site.

Initially if a car was saved to a user's garage, it would persist for whoever visited it, since the cars were saved to JawsDB which is an add-on for Heroku, sort of a stand-in database.
